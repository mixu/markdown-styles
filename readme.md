## Features

- Ready-made CSS stylesheets for Markdown, just copy the assets folder you want
- Bundled with `generate-md`, a small tool that converts a folder of Markdown documents into a output folder of HTML documents, preserving the directory structure)
- Use your own custom markup and CSS via `--layout`.
- Support for relative paths to the assets folder via `{{assetsRelative}}` and document table of content generation via `{{toc}}`.
- Support for generic metadata via a meta.json file

-----
## Quickstart

Install `generate-md` via npm:

    sudo npm install -g markdown-styles

Create a markdown file and then convert it to html:

    mkdir input/
    echo "# Hello world\n YOLO" > input/index.md
    generate-md --layout mixu-gray --input ./input --output ./output
    google-chrome ./output/index.html

Try out different layouts by changing the `--layout` parameter; screenshots at the bottom of this page.

If you want to make use of the bundled layouts stylesheets as a basis for your own site, copy the ./assets folder and point `--layout` to your own layout.

For example:

    git clone https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles.git ./markdown-styles
    cp -Rv ./markdown-styles/layouts/mixu-gray ./my-layout
    nano ./my-layout/page.html

Now edit the files `./my-layout/page.html` and run:

    generate-md --layout ./my-layout/page.html --input ./input --output ./output

## Just using the stylesheets

Alternatively, if you just want the stylesheets for your own project, you can just copy the `./assets` folder from the layout you want.

To preview the styles in the browser, clone this repo locally and then open `./output/index.html` or run `make preview` which opens that page in your default browser.

## Using generate-md

This project also includes a small tool for generating HTML files from Markdown files.

The console tool is `generate-md`, e.g.

    generate-md --layout jasonm23-foghorn --output ./test/

[Here is an example](https://github.com/zendesk/radar/blob/gh-pages/Makefile) of how I generated the project docs for [Radar](https://github.com/zendesk/radar) using generate-md, a Makefile and a few custom assets.

`--input` specifies the input directory (default: `./input/`).

`--output` specifies the output directory (default: `./output/`).

`--layout` specifies the layout to use. This can be either one of built in layouts, or a path to a custom template file with a set of custom assets.

To override the layout, simply create a directory, such as `./my-theme/`, with the following structure:

````bash
├── my-theme
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── css
│   │   ├── img
│   │   └── js
│   └── page.html

````

Then, running a command like:

      generate-md --input ./input/ --layout ./my-theme/page.html --output ./test/

will:

1. convert all Markdown files in `./input` to HTML files under `./test`, preserving paths in `./input`.
2. use the template `./my-theme/page.html`, replacing values such as `{{content}}`, `{{toc}}` and `{{assetsRelative}}` (see the layouts for examples on this)
3. (recursively) copy over the assets from `./my-theme/assets` to `./test/assets`.

This means that you could, for example, point a HTTP server at the root of `./test/` and be done with it.

You can also use the current directory as the output (e.g. for Github pages).

## New! Syntax highlighting support

`generate-md` supports syntax highlighting during the Markdown-to-HTML conversion process.

To enable the syntax highlighting support, install `highlight.js`:

    npm install --save highlight.js markdown-styles

Note that you need to install `markdown-styles` locally like shown above and invoke it as `./node_modules/.bin/generate-md`, so that `require('highlight.js')` will find the module we just installed locally.

You will also need to include [one of the highlight.js CSS style sheets](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html) in your assets folder/layout file CSS (e.g. by using a custom `--layout` file).

## New! --command

`--command <cmd>`: Pipe each Markdown file through a shell command and capture the output before converting. Useful for filtering the file, for example.

## New! --asset-dir

`--asset-dir <path>`: Normally, the asset directory is assumed to be `./assets/` in the same folder the `--layout` file is. You can override it to a different asset directory explicitly with `--asset-dir`, which is useful for builds where several directories use the same layout but different asset directories.

## New! --number-toc

`--number-toc`: Normally `{{toc}}` will produce a list of headings without any indication as to their rank. By providing this argument the generated Table of Contents will include numerical hierarchical descriptors on the left of each heading in the Table of Contents only.

## Metadata support

You can also add a file named `meta.json` to the folder from which you run `generate-md`.

The metadata in that directory will be read and replacements will be made for corresponding `{{names}}` in the template.

The metadata is scoped by the top-level directory in `./input`.

For example:

````json
{
  "foo": {
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles"
  }
}
````

would make the metadata value `{{repoUrl}}` available in the template, for all files that are in the directory `./input/foo`.

This is rather imperfect, but works for small stuff, feel free to contribute improvements back.

## Screenshots of the layouts

Note: these screenshots are generate via cutycapt, so they look worse than they do in a real browser.

## Adding new styles

Create a new directory under `./output/themename`.

If a file called `./layouts/themename/page.html` exists, it is used, otherwise the default footer and header in `./layouts/plain/` are used.

The switcher is an old school frameset, you need to add a link in `./output/menu.html`.

To regenerate the pages, you need node:

    git clone git://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles.git
    npm install
    make build

To regenerate the screenshots, you need cutycapt (or some other Webkit to image tool) and imagemagic. On Ubuntu / Debian, that's:

    sudo aptitude install cutycapt imagemagick

You also need to install the web fonts locally so that cutycapt will find them, run `node font-download.js` to get the commands you need to run (basically a series of wget and fc-cache -fv commands).

Finally, run:

    make screenshots
